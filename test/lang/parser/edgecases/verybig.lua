Some General Developer Notes

Some of the coding here is far from ideal ;p (I was learning Lua & XML while I wrote it, so buhu2u)
But at the time I write this, (v6.BETA), I don't have a gaming account to test with, and a complete re-write is out of the question :(

I have added some comments throughout the code.
And here are some general ramblings that might help someone who's puzzling over the code :

local_player.currentNote.unit & local_player.currentNote.general			:	These variables are global to the AddOn and refer to the note names for the currently Open 
						Contact & General notes respectively. Some functions process notes in the background while
						the user potentially has a note open, and the code will sometimes copy these values to temporary
						variables, use them in processing, and then reset them to the saved temporary values.
						I'm not sure this is necessary in some cases, but as I can't test any more, I'm sticking to the rule of
						thumb "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" Oh, for a OO approach from the very beginning ;P

Note Sizes (6006 characters)
						This is controlled by the constants : 
							NuNC.NUN_MAX_ADD_TXT = 5;
							NuNC.NUN_MAX_TXT_CHR = 1001;
						WoW originally limited the size of the text fields that could be saved in SavedVariables, so my solution
						was to split the note in to my own chunks of text and save them as sequential text fields.
						The splitting and concatenation of these chunks in to single notes is handled by the SetCText, GetCText,
						SetGText, and GetGText functions, (i.e. for Contact & General notes)
						To avoid Blizzard substituting invalid character sequences in to NotesUNeed notes when the game ends
						and Saved Variables are actually saved - NuN also substitutes certain special characters within notes.
						i.e. this stops Blizzard carrying out its own substitution of these characters which has been known to
						lead to crashes and loss of entire NuN databases.
						These character substitutions are carried out in the background and hidden from the end user, and are
						handled by the _SetSaveText, and _SetDisplayText functions.

User Definable Buttons			Users can define their own button values for the 10 buttons in the top left of the Contact note frame
						 There are 5 Headings buttons with default values, and 5 Details Buttons left blank by default
						 The first 2 Heading buttons are Guild, and Guild Rank by default, and if left un-changed, then NuN will try to auto-populate Guild information in to the first 2 Detail buttons
						 If a Heading is blanked, then the associated Detail button is disabled
						 They can have a different value for a specific Contact note saved in NuNData
						 OR They can have a new default for all Contacts saved in NuNSettings
						 OR NuN will use its own hard coded defaults

Note Saving Levels				i.e. Saving at Realm level or Account level
						Player Notes are always saved at Realm level, and the code doesn't have to worry about duplicates;
						Ofc, this means users can't see Player notes made on other Realms
						General Notes can be saved at Realm, or account level.
						The user is allowed to have multiple notes with the same name saved on different Realms.
						But can't have the same note saved at Account Level as well.
						NotesUNeed will give a warning when you are about to save a new note with the same name as an existing note

receiptPending			:	NuN allows Players to send each other Notes - See the various comments in the ChatMessage_EventHandler hook
						If someone sends you a note that has the same name as one of your existing notes, then you are presented
						with a duplicate record dialog box, and flagged as receiptPending, until you decide to either replace your note
						with the one being sent to you, or reject the one that has been sent to you.
						This flag stops you from doing things that could result in corrupted data, such as trying to alter the original
	 					note, or open a new one, and or displaying yet another note from a third party.....
						(Other players aren't informed that you are receiptPending - its just a local measure to try and prevent any data
						corruption until you make your mind up)

MapNotes integration			NotesUNeed allows creation of MapNotes at the Player's current location; And while standing in a single location, you can create multiple 
						MapNotes that will be merged on the same Map note - NotesUNeed creates an index of the notes merged this way,
						and shows a little sub-menu detailing the separate notes merged on that point when you mouse over the Map note - this sub-menu can itself be moused
						over (when the <control> key is pressed to show tooltips for each individual note, or clicked to open the note (or clicked to delete the note and remove
						it from the merged MapNotes)
						Best to experiment to understand - stand in one place with a few NPCs around.
						Have MapNotes (Fan's Update) installed
						Have auto-Map Noting of NPCs turned on.
						Without moving, create NotesUNeed notes for several NPCs around you
						You should see a few MapNotes creation messages in the chat frame.
						Open, the map and play with the MapNote thus created.

The following two tables group together all of the info about the note currently being viewed or opened.  I would like to move them to locals, but due to the fact
that this version (6.64) will also contain all of the changes necessary to support the 4.0.1 WoW patch (Cataclysm), I think I'll wait till that all settles down
before making such a risky change.
So, I'll leave the tables themselves at the global scope, and just stick all of the related data (which has always been declared at file scope, anyway) inside
these tables to reduce the number of local variables we have at file scope (as we're also hitting the upper limit on the number of local vars at a single scope).
